# City Explorer API

**Author**: Grace Choi
**Version**: 1.0.4

## Overview
Lab08: 
1. Database Setup & Table Creation
2. Revise functions to check database for location information and send the location object to the client. If it does not exist, route to API for request and then save it in the database. 
3. Deploy on Heroku

## Getting Started
1. Create a database environment variable & a schema.sql file and connect to postgres.
2. Use if/else statements within function to cache queries and store them if it's not already stored. 
4. Deploy on Heroku and replicate the local database to Heroku. Confirm server is responding as expected.
